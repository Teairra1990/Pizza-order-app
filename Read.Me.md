After a month of learning Python, I’m finally serving hot code with a side of pepperoni! 👩🏽‍💻🔥

## 🧠 What I Learned:
- GUI building with **Tkinter**
- Using **radio buttons** for pizza sizes
- Using **checkboxes** for toppings
- Dropdowns (listboxes) for **payment methods**
- Generating random **Order Numbers**
- Handling **input/output** with interactive labels
- Building full Python apps from scratch!

## 🚀 Features:
- 🍕 Choose pizza size (Small, Medium, Large)
- 🧀 Select toppings (Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Olives)
- 💰 Choose payment method (Cash, Card, or Gold Coins if you’re fancy)
- 📦 Generates a random order number
- 🎉 Displays a custom thank-you message with order summary

## 🛠️ Tech Used:
- Python 3.12
- Tkinter (for the GUI)

## 🔮 Bonus
This is part of a larger journey to build my programming skills one slice at a time 🍕💻
